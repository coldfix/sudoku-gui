sudoku-cli
----------

Simple sudoku generator / solver GUI.

Be warned, I coded this as a teenager in circa 2006-2007 and imported into git
later. I now found some time to fix compile time errors on linux with gcc with
an absolute minimum of changes. The code is horrible C++98/03 and you may not
want to look at it.

Build
~~~~~

- linux::

    make

- windows: I don't know whether the MSVC++ project files will still work
