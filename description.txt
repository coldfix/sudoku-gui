2. The application

wxSudoku (C) allows you to generate and solve sudokus.

Sudokus can be entered manually or generated by the computer.
You can also load the sudokus from text files (and save to). The underlying file format is easy to understand.

Selecting "New" from the menu allows you to specify custom dimensions for your sudoku.
Since wxSudoku is optimized for 3x3 and 2x3 sudokus, the solver's behaviour when specifying different dimensions can be annoyingly time consuming.
This is why it is NOT recommended to generate sudokus with more than 16 cells per block!

If you like to print a sudoku, save it as .html-file and print that one afterwards with your preferred browser.

Having loaded/generated/entered a sudoku, you can begin to solve it by disabling the "Edit Sudoku" mode.
However, edit mode cannot be disabled if the sudoku is either invalid or ambiguous.

Use of [Tab] or [Return] enables you to work both in a row-oriented and in a column-oriented way.
