2. The application

Sudoku Solver (C) allows you to generate and solve sudokus.

You can manually type sudokus in or just let the computer create them for you.
You could also load the sudokus from text files. The underlying file format is easy to understand.

Selecting "New" from the menu allows you to specify custom dimensions for your sudoku.
Since Sudoku Solver is optimized for 3x3 and 2x3 sudokus, the solver's behaviour when specifying different dimensions might sometimes be annoying.
It is not recommended to generate sudokus with more than 10 fields per square!

If you like to print a sudoku, save it as .html-file and print that one afterwards. The sudoku is always saved just as you currently see it on the screen.

After having loaded/generated or typed in a sudoku, you can solve it on your own by disabling the "Enter Sudoku" mode.

Creation mode cannot be disabled if the sudoku has either no solution or more than one.
It also cannot be disabled if sudoku solver is not able to solve the underlying sudoku, even if it is uniquely solvable (although that case is not very likely).

Use of [Tab] or [Return] enables you to work both in a row-oriented and in a column-oriented way.
